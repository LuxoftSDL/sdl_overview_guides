## PerformAudioPassThru

`PerformAudioPassThru` feeds you with audio data through the vehicleâ€™s microphone. The audio data could be used in cloud-based and on-line voice recognition to achieve dynamic and diversified user interaction, like POI search, information query. Or even record the voice when driver is singing. The audio data is in form of PCM, and its sampling rate, bit width, timeout can be set in the `PerformAudioPassThru` request per your requirement. The headunit transmits its supported parameters via the `registerAppInterface` response. 16bit/16kHz is a widely supported configuration, which delivers good audio quality.

The parameter `muteAudio` is used to define whether to mute current audio source during AudioPassThru session.

When the `PerformAudioPassThru` is used for voice recognition, `muteAudio` should be set to true to minimize audio interference.

If you want to mix the input audio from `PerformAudioPassThru` session with current audio source, eg. a karaoke app recording both the user's voice and the background music, you can set `muteAudio` to false.

`onAudioPassThru` keeps you updated with the audio data transfer every 250ms.

`EndAudioPassThru` enables you end the audio capture, prematurely. This is useful if your App analyzes the audio level and detects that the user stopped speaking.
