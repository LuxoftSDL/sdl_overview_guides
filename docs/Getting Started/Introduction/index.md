## Getting Started Introduction


SmartDeviceLink (SDL) as a technology is laid out in a white-paper available [here](https://smartdevicelink.com/resources/). This doc will focus on the basics in how to use SDL.

The first steps in connecting an SDL app are the following:

1. Establish a transport level connection
2. App initiates a protocol level session start, Core accepts.
3. App registers itself onto the head unit. Core responds with system information
4. Activating the App
