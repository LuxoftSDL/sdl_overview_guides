## 4. Activating the App

At this point, the app should have started its SDL protocol session, registered through the RPC service, and be displayed in some sort of app list. The next step is to activate the app by selecting it from the list. This will inform the app that their HMI status has changed to one that is visible, and the app will start to send all its content to the head unit.
